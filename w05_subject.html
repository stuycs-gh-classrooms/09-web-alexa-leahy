    <h2> Characters </h2>
        <p> Hay Day features many characters including the user who can customize their name at the beginning of the game. Another character is Greg who helps the player out throughout the game and serves as a mentor whose farm you can buy goods from. My personal favorite character is Tom who the player can unlock by paying diamonds (which are an ingame courtesy). Tom's job is to find items that the player requests. </p>

<h2> Achievements </h2>
<p> In Hay Day the player can earn XP by harvesting crops and interacting with special request orders they receive. As the player levels up they unclock achievements, or new things in the game. Some of the notable features you can unlock include the boat, the neighborhood derby, and more service buildings. </p>

	<h2> Animals </h2>
<p> In addition to crops, another main feature of Hay Day is animals. The animals easiest to get are chicken, pig, and cow. With these animals, you can collect the products they produce, like eggs and milk, to use to bake different things. </p>
