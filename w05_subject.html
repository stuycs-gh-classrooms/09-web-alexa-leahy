    <h2> Characters </h2>
        <p> Hay Day features many characters,  <a href="https://scontent-lga3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/12512533_1022214334529800_2803227846746007715_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c2f564&_nc_ohc=Di1Wxj0QVk4AX-ON6RM&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.xx&oh=00_AfCPWEUbg7jJvWJU6HatXPTzB5r7dETF7WuxhR5HMVg48w&oe=65EDE516"> wiki page for full list of charcters </a> including the user who can customize their name at the beginning of the game. Another character is Greg who helps the player out throughout the game and serves as a mentor whose farm you can buy goods from. My personal favorite character is Tom who the player can unlock by paying diamonds (which are an ingame courtesy). Tom's job is to find items that the player requests. </p>

<h2> Achievements </h2>
<p> In Hay Day the player can earn XP by harvesting crops and interacting with special request orders they receive. As the player levels up they unclock achievements, or new things in the game. Some of the notable features you can unlock include the boat, the neighborhood derby, and more service buildings. There are also achievements you can gain from doing different side quests in the monthly events, for instance, harvesting 100 carrots. <a href="https://hayday.fandom.com/wiki/Experience">  This is the wiki page for full list of achievements </a></p>

	<h2> Animals </h2>
<p> In addition to crops, another main feature of Hay Day is animals. The animals easiest to get are chicken, pig, and cow, <a href="https://hayday.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Farm_Animals">  here is the wiki page for full list of animals </a>. With these animals, you can collect the products they produce, like eggs and milk, to use to bake different things. You can make different goods with the animal products by placing them in the machines like the bakery which will make wheat. </p>
