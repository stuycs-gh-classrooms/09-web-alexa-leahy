    <h2> Achievements </h2>
    <p> In Hay Day the player can earn XP by harvesting crops and interacting with special request orders they receive. As the player levels up they unclock achievements, or new things in the game. Some of the notable features you can unlock include the boat, the neighborhood derby, and more service buildings. There are also achievements you can gain from doing different side quests in the monthly events, for instance, harvesting 100 carrots. <a href="https://hayday.fandom.com/wiki/Experience">  This is the wiki page for full list of achievements </a></p>
