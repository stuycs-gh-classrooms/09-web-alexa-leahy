  <h2> Greg </h2>
  <p> Greg a level 151 NPC and is the first character that the player meets in the game. He is meant to be the farmer/player's mentor throughout the game and walk the player through the beginning stages of caring for your farm animals and processing goods in the various machines (I will elaborate on the machines later). The player can visit Greg's farm via the "Friends" tab located on the bottom of the screen and purchase goods from Greg's roadside shop which resets the items every 24 hours. For 5 diamonds the player can reset the items Greg sells before the 24 hours if they would like to. A fun fact about Greg's farm is that he has every machine and animal in the game on it!
