        <h2> Characters </h2>
            <p> Hay Day features many characters,  <a href="https://scontent-lga3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/12512533_1022214334529800_2803227846746007715_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=c2f564&_nc_ohc=Di1Wxj0QVk4AX-ON6RM&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.xx&oh=00_AfCPWEUbg7jJvWJU6HatXPTzB5r7dETF7WuxhR5HMVg48w&oe=65EDE516"> wiki page for full list of charcters </a> including the user who can customize their name at the beginning of the game. Another character is Greg who helps the player out throughout the game and serves as a mentor whose farm you can buy goods from. My personal favorite character is Tom who the player can unlock by paying diamonds (which are an ingame courtesy). Tom's job is to find items that the player requests. </p>
